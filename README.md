# Dealroad v.0.1.0

Dealroad is a tool app which makes it easier to view current deals on multiple supermarkets. Using the power of web engines and some clever designing we can offer real time deal data optimized for mobile devices with barely any compromises.

## Future plans ##
- Test iOS support, fix SVG's in ios and add non app store installation instructions for iOS
- Optimize supported supermarkets(only present relevant sections & remove non necessary)
- Add more supermarkets/stores(Kaufland, Penny, Netto, Edeka, Dm, ...)
- Optimize subsections(E.g Aldi)

## Features being thought of ##
- Allow users to input their own deal pages, the caviat being that they will not be optimized in the same way supported supermarkets are
- Allow users to select the order of the selected supermarkets/stores, aswell as default when app opens
- Allow users to create a shopping list


## Limitations ##

With the current architecture implementing features such as displaying a personalized deals dashboard from a aggregation of all selected supermarkets is not possible. In the future maybe we will change to a web scrapping architecture this in term will allow us to have much more flexibility in what is possible to implement.
