# Dealroad v.1.0.0

Dealroad is a tool app which makes it easier to view current deals on multiple supermarkets. Using the power of web engines and some clever designing we can offer real time deal data optimized for mobile devices with barely any compromises.

With the latest version users can now enter and manage their own custom "deals" pages and even add their own optimizations.

## Future plans ##
The App is finalised (01.10.2023), it does everything i need for my usage.

## Limitations ##

With the current architecture implementing features such as displaying a personalized deals dashboard from a aggregation of all selected supermarkets is not possible. In the future maybe we will change to a web scrapping architecture this in term will allow us to have much more flexibility in what is possible to implement.
